# Shel

Shel is an Alexa skill that will recite really bad poetry generated by a neural net trained on Shel Silverstein poems.

## Notebook
`shel_model.ipynb` contains code for scraping poems and building the the model. It also has an infinite loop that will keep generating poems and dumping them in `lambda/poems`. Originally I planned to dynamically generate a new poem on each request, but including all the necessary libraries pushed the zip file way past Lambda's 50mb limit, so I went with this preprocessing step instead.

## Lambda
Run `./build` to build a zip file to upload to AWS Lambda
